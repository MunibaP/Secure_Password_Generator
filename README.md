## Installation

To install the challenge #1 project, first create a new repository in your GitHub account, and then clone this repository to your local computer.

To clone: git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git

## Deployment

1. Deploy your code by running "git add", "git commit", and "git push" in your local repository.

2. Visit your GitHub repository online, click 'Settings', and then select 'Pages' on the left.

3. In GitHub Pages, set the 'main' branch as the source and click 'Save'.

4. Access your live site at <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name>. For example, if your username is "lernantino" and your repo is "css-demo-site", the URL is <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.
